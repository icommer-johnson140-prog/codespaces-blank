# Function - instructions for executing codes


# to create a function, we start with the "def" keyboard
# this is the function definition 
# this describe the steps/instructions that we want our
# code to do

    print ('step 2. spread peanutbutter on one slice of bread')
    print( 'step 3. spread jelly/jam on other slice ')
'  print (step 4. put slices together with spreads facing eachother')
    # to acrually run a function you need to write its name
    # this called a function call, or function invocation
