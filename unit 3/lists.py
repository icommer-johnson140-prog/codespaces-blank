 # List - is a type of collection system where we can store and 
# organize multiple forms of data

# we create lists using the square brackets and assigning it to variable
#Example == [1,2,3,4,5,'name','dob','year',True,[1,2,3,4,False,1,2, False,1.2]]

#print(Example)


# we use lists to structure data in large applications

#Videos = ['cat video','music video,','dancing videos']


# we can manipulate lists to add,remove,sort,etc
