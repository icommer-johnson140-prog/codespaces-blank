"3. And return true if both statements are true" " == just mean equal too" " '>' is greater than"

"6. Information can be passed to methods as parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method , an a argument pass data through "

"8. fuction is how code is ran/processed and without your code wouldnt be ran"

"1. input- allows us to change decimals into whole number, float allows us to change whole numbers decimal, intergers - number values that can only be whole numbers  "

" 7. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called, And a function inovacation is calling and using the function"
