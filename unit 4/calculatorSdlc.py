# use the SDLC steps we learned to build a simple calculator app.

# Ideate - what are some features we can implement into our calculator

'1. User should be able to put input and calculator numbers.'

'2. Users should be able to create different types of graphs (bar chart,scatter plot,etc).'

'3. Convert imperial units into metric units.'

# Analysis and requirements - based on the code concepts we've learned, how
# Can we make ideas more tangible in code.
# what types of data do we need?
# what operators do we need?
# do we need to use conditionals? or loops? or both?


'1. We will need to use integer and float data type to represent our number values'
'we can use input to pass in the data types into our program. we can use the arthmetic operators to do our calculators'
''
'2. we could use the comparison operators to make some of our graphing logic.'
'we can install another python library to do graphs for us.'

'3. we need to have the metric unit stored in a variable and then, do some arithmetic operation to convert and get that result'
# example
inch= 1
foot = 12 
meter = 39.3701
